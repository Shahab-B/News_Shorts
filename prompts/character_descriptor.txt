You are working with a structured, multi-scene video script. Each scene contains two blocks:

**Narration:** (spoken voiceover — DO NOT modify)  
**Scene Description:** (visual description to guide animation — MODIFY as needed)

---

### Your Tasks:

1. Identify **every unique, singular human character** mentioned in the scene sections of the script.  
   - This includes: full names (e.g., "Wess Roley") and relational phrases (e.g., "Roley's grandfather")  
   - Exclude generic or group-based roles (e.g., "firefighters", "law enforcement", "officials")

2. For each valid person, generate a **full, self-contained visual descriptor** including:
   - Gender  
   - Approximate age (if known or implied)  
   - Hair color  
   - Distinctive facial expression, demeanor, or posture  
   - Format: e.g., `"a young man with dark hair and a somber expression"`

3. In **every Scene Description** (but never in Narration):
   - Fully and literally replace all references to the character with their descriptor.
   - This includes:
     - Full names
     - First names
     - Last names
     - Possessives (e.g., “Wess’s”, “Roley’s”, “Wess Roley’s”)
     - Relational references (e.g., “Roley's grandfather”)
     - Nicknames, diminutives, or indirect phrasing (e.g., “the boy”, “the arsonist”)

4. When a character is mentioned **more than once within the same Scene Description**, do **not** repeat the full descriptor every time. Instead:
   - Use a shortened phrase like **"the man"**, **"the figure"**, or restructure the sentence naturally.
   - Only use such shorthand **after** the full descriptor has already appeared **once in that block**.
   - Never use vague or generic pronouns (e.g., ❌ “he”, “his”) unless they are visually anchored.

5. For possessives:
   - ❌ Incorrect: `"a tall man’s coat"`  
   - ✅ Correct: `"the coat of a tall man"`

6. **DO NOT MODIFY NARRATION BLOCKS.** Only rewrite the **Scene Description** sections.

7. **Do NOT generate descriptors** for generic group roles:
   - 'firefighters', 'law enforcement officers', 'authorities', 'emergency responders', 'paramedics', 'officials'
   - Leave these terms unchanged.

8. Ensure **every Scene Description is self-contained** and understandable without relying on prior scenes.
